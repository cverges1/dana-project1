# Malkin Made | Developer Test

## This mockup is meant to test your development knowledge.
Do everything you can. Add comments to your code when you can to explain your decisions and ask questions you might want me to answer in a review.

## Direction
Recreate the design with all the provided assets to the best of your ability.
Utilize XD if possible to match the grid, columns, and sizing of all the elements.
Ideally, your code will PERFECTLY match (to the pixel) the design files.

## HTML sections in design:
1. Header
2. Hero
3. 3 column
4. 2 column (with image)
5. 1 column with video embed
6. Dropdowns (OPTIONAL - only if you want to use js)
7. Footer

## Languages Required
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS (if you build block 6)

## Bonus Tech
1. Bootstrap (HIGHLY RECOMMEND using a framework. This will save you a lot of time with the grid and spacing classes) - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/
2. Sage starter (this is getting pretty advanced) - https://docs.roots.io/sage/10.x/installation/
3. Wordpress CMS for your content (will need to utilize PHP to do this)
4. Sass and a compiler for your style code
5. Animations on load? - https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

## Final Deliverables
1. A index.html file of this template
2. Necessary style files 
3. Necessary js files (if building block 6)
